                    <h2>How often should I clean my pool?</h2>
                    <p>At Spark Pool Cleaning, we understand that maintaining a pristine pool is essential for both enjoyment and safety. One of the most frequently asked questions from pool owners in Westway Texas  is, "How often should I clean my pool?" The answer can vary based on several factors, including pool usage, local climate, and surrounding environment.<br>For most pools, a weekly cleaning schedule is ideal. This routine maintenance helps to ensure that your pool remains in excellent condition, preventing the build-up of debris, algae, and bacteria. Weekly cleaning typically includes skimming the surface for leaves and debris, brushing the pool walls and floor, and vacuuming any settled dirt. Additionally, it’s important to check and balance the chemical levels regularly to maintain clean and safe water.<br>However, in areas with high pollen counts or frequent storms, you may need to clean your pool more often to address increased debris. Similarly, if your pool sees heavy use, such as frequent pool parties or swimming lessons, more frequent cleanings may be necessary to manage the higher load of contaminants.<br>At Spark Pool Cleaning, serving all cities in Westway Texas we offer tailored cleaning services to meet your pool’s specific needs. Our expert team ensures that your pool is sparkling clean and properly maintained, so you can enjoy a refreshing swim anytime. Trust Spark Pool Cleaning for reliable and comprehensive pool care in Westway Texas and keep your pool in top shape year-round.</p>

                    <h2>How can I prevent algae from growing in my pool?</h2>
                    <p>Preventing algae growth in your pool is crucial to maintaining clean and clear water, and it’s a common concern for pool owners in Westway Texas . At Spark Pool Cleaning, we recommend a proactive approach to keeping algae at bay, ensuring your pool is always ready for a refreshing swim.<br>The first and most important step is maintaining the right chemical balance. Algae thrive in pools where chlorine levels are too low. Regularly check and adjust your pool's chlorine, pH, and alkalinity levels to ensure they remain within the ideal range. We recommend testing the water at least twice a week, especially during the hot summer months in Westway Texas . Proper water balance creates an environment where algae cannot grow.<br>Circulation is another key factor. Ensure your pool’s pump and filtration system are running efficiently. Stagnant water becomes a breeding ground for algae. Running the pool pump for 8-12 hours daily helps circulate chemicals evenly and prevents algae spores from settling. Additionally, brushing the pool walls and floor weekly helps remove any algae spores that might be clinging to surfaces.<br>Lastly, regular shock treatments provide an extra boost to your pool's defense system. Shock your pool at least once a month or after heavy use. Spark Pool Cleaning offers expert services in Westway Texas  to handle all aspects of algae prevention, from water testing to thorough cleaning. Trust our team to keep your pool algae-free, so you can enjoy crystal-clear water throughout the year.</p>
