                    <h2>How can I prevent algae from growing in my pool?</h2>
                    <p>Preventing algae growth in your pool is crucial to maintaining clean and clear water, and it’s a common concern for pool owners in St Georges Delaware . At Spark Pool Cleaning, we recommend a proactive approach to keeping algae at bay, ensuring your pool is always ready for a refreshing swim.<br>The first and most important step is maintaining the right chemical balance. Algae thrive in pools where chlorine levels are too low. Regularly check and adjust your pool's chlorine, pH, and alkalinity levels to ensure they remain within the ideal range. We recommend testing the water at least twice a week, especially during the hot summer months in St Georges Delaware . Proper water balance creates an environment where algae cannot grow.<br>Circulation is another key factor. Ensure your pool’s pump and filtration system are running efficiently. Stagnant water becomes a breeding ground for algae. Running the pool pump for 8-12 hours daily helps circulate chemicals evenly and prevents algae spores from settling. Additionally, brushing the pool walls and floor weekly helps remove any algae spores that might be clinging to surfaces.<br>Lastly, regular shock treatments provide an extra boost to your pool's defense system. Shock your pool at least once a month or after heavy use. Spark Pool Cleaning offers expert services in St Georges Delaware  to handle all aspects of algae prevention, from water testing to thorough cleaning. Trust our team to keep your pool algae-free, so you can enjoy crystal-clear water throughout the year.</p>
